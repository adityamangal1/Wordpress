== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with the theme that I am using? =

Our tests indicate that the elements work well with most themes that are well coded. You may need some minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important keyword.

The demo site is best recreated with a theme that supports a full width page template without sidebars. The elements can still be used in the pages of default template.

= How to enable the dark version for any element? =

In Elementor page builder, edit the section wrapper for the element representing a row of elements. Navigate to the 'Advanced' tab of the 'Edit Section' sidebar window. Scroll down to the bottom of this tab to the 'Advanced' section and input class ‘lae-dark-bg’ in the 'CSS Classes' field to activate the dark version of an element.

= My portfolio does not show any items. =

Pls install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-post-type/" title="Portfolio Post Type">Portfolio Post Type plugin</a> to enable custom post type Portfolio.
